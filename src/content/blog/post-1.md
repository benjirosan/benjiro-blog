A beginning. A setting off. A step towards what comes next.

Fear. What if I write that which others don't like? What if I get it wrong? 

Acceptance. I can only write the things I know and be open to the things I don't.

Remembering. I write because it feels right. I write to connect pieces of a larger puzzle. 

A list. I write about shame to:

- Bring awareness to an experience that affects many
- Understand the components of shame
- Chronicle my progress as change unfolds
- Acknowledge the twists and turns to assist fellow travellers

I look forward to taking the next small step.
